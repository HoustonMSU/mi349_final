            <p class="introText">This portfolio contains some of my games that I have made during 
                my tenure at Michigan State University. You will find an image
                along with a description of each game for each entry. For more information, select

            <p class="description"> You are Laramie, a valentine's day ghost! However, you have a broken heart, and the only
                way you think you'll be able to fix it is to make other people fall in love! You must 
                possess various objects throughout the levels in order to progress - but beware - while
                you are a ghost and can not take damage, the objects you can posess are a bit more fragile...
                <br> <br>

                My roles on this project included creating audio assets, as well as working on some user interface regarding the different menus (such as
                the level select menu, main menu, credits, in-game menu, etc). I have also been a QA tester for the game during this semester, and have
                provided feedback for the rest of the team in terms of any issues/bugs that might have occured while different features were being
                developed and implemented.

            <p class="description"> You are a futuristic warrior armed with only a shield - placed in an arena with 3 other warriors who are keen on your certain destruction! Angle Warrior 
                is themed like a retro arcade game, and is best played with friends and family! 
                The rules are simple: be the last man standing. However you can not directly attack each other - instead, you must use your shield in order to deflect incoming projectiles
                towards your enemies.

                My roles on this project included being the game designer, audio designer, and UI designer. My primary focus, however, was on brainstorming different as a game designer 
                to make sure that the play experience is fun and captivating. I produced all of the audio assets and designed all of the menus.
