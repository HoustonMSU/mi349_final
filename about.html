            <p class="description"> Hello! I am Isaac Houston, a Media and Information student at Michigan State University. I am also minoring in the Game Design and Development
                program offered at MSU, and am primarily focused on becoming a versatile and well-rounded game designer. I am currently a Senior, and am set to graduate after Spring semester
                of 2021. This portfolio website is designed by myself for my MI349 final project. 

                <br><br>
                Some of my hobbies include woodworking, playing tennis, writing, playing the accordion and piano, and (as expected) game development. 
                <bR><br>
                Note: This website does not contain all of my projects, and is purely designed for being my MI-349 final project submission.
